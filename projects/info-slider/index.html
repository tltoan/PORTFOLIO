                Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually
                against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two
                players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket strung
                with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt
                over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object
                of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the
                opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player unable
                to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the
                opposite player will. -Wikipedia

                In Jeu de Paume, players hit the ball with their hands instead
                of using rackets, which were introduced later. The game was
                popular among the French nobility and quickly spread across
                Europe, including to England and Italy. In England, King Henry
                VIII became a notable fan of the game, and it was during his
                reign that indoor courts were built in royal palaces.

                Modern tennis as we know it began in 1873, when Major Walter
                Clopton Wingfield, a British army officer, developed a new
                version of the game that he called Sphairistikè (a Greek word
                meaning “ball playing”). Wingfield's version of the game was
                designed to be played on grass, which is why tennis is often
                referred to as "lawn tennis." The game was first played at
                Leamington Spa, England, and quickly gained popularity among the
                British upper class. The first Wimbledon Championship, the
                oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament, was held in 1877
                at the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club.

                In 1968, professional tennis players were allowed to compete in
                the Grand Slam tournaments for the first time. This marked the
                beginning of the Open Era in tennis, which allowed both amateur
                and professional players to compete in the same events. The move
                to professionalism transformed the sport, making it more
                competitive and increasing the popularity of the game around the
                world.

                In 1972, male players formed the Association of Tennis
                Professionals (ATP), and in 1973, female players led by Billie
                Jean King created the Women's Tennis Association (WTA). King’s
                1973 “Battle of the Sexes” victory was a pivotal moment for
                women’s tennis.
